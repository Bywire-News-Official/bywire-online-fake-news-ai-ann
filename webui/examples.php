	    "article content"=>"An independent investigation by credible sources that may or may not be tied to the federal task force to investigate the Clintons has found that the New York City coroner who signed Jeffrey Epstein’s death cerificate was on the Clinton Foundation’s Board of Trustees until 2015. This report, which is an alleged excerpt from the Foundation’s public filings, has not been doctored at all. It shows clearly that Eric Braverman, the same man who declared Epstein’s death a suicide, made nearly $500K in 2015 for a cushy 45-hour per week job. At first, our investigators were skeptical, because the Coroner’s name isn’t technically \"Eric Braverman\" at all. It’s Dr. Arturo Tubbolski under the assumed name of Greg. Our investigator in the field, Skip Tetheluda, explains\" Greg was first hired as Art, but then his roommate transitioned from Leon to Linda, which made him a little uncomfortable. He moved in with Chelsea Clinton’s best friend from Dartmouth and before long he had taken over the position of Eric Braverman, the Foundation’s chief Operating Officer. We believe the real Braverman is buried wherever they put Vince Foster and Dimitri Noonan. Anyway, the fact that both men are listed makes this a slam dunk, yet the New York Attorney General, Sandiford Batt, won’t press charges. It’s a clear-cut caes of the Deep State covering their crimes.” Well if that doesn’t make perfect sense then nothing does. At this point, this Greg character needs to be found and locked up. According to the City of New York, he never worked there at all. Because Epstein has no family and left no will, there’s nobody to contest it. At least it’s finally over. We’ll never know how many of Clinton’s 26 trips were actually true now.",

During the fundraising gala on Saturday night to a crowd of primarily LGBT supporters, Biden also called Trump staff and supporters, “Some of…the dregs of society,” adding that they have an ally currently in the White House.

Biden has said he'll decide in January - after the midterms - whether to make a run against Trump in 2020.

       "article_content"=>"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s son Paul Pelosi Jr. visited Ukraine in 2017 to meet with government officials in connection to a business initiative. Now, unearthed records reveal that Paul Pelosi Jr. was an executive of a gas industry company that did business in Ukraine – and his mother Nancy Pelosi was featured in one of the company’s promotional videos.

Paul Pelosi Jr. travelled to Kiev, Ukraine in July 2017 in his capacity as executive director of the Corporate Governance Initiative, a position that he accepted months earlier in February 2017. Pelosi Jr. said that he was in Ukraine to discuss a youth soccer partnership with the government.

The American Mirror, which flagged Pelosi Jr.’s appearance in 2017, preserved a clip of Pelosi Jr. on the Ukrainian station following the video’s removal from YouTube.

As Patrick Howley found, Paul Pelosi Jr. previously held top positions with the energy-sector companies Viscoil Group and NRGLab.

On March 5, 2013, NRGLab New Technology posted two videos on Youtube. One video opened with a clip of Nancy Pelosi discussing energy-efficient technology, followed by a direct-to-camera statement from her son Paul Pelosi Jr., filmed in Washington, D.C. in 2010.

“My name’s Paul Pelosi. Of course I’m on the board of Viscoil. And Viscoil is here today to talk about accelerating the future. It’s about using cars in a more efficient manner. It’s about utilizing natural resources, whether it be electricity, or gas, or fossil fuels in a more efficient way. And Viscoil is a part of that solution,” Paul Pelosi Jr. said in the video.
 
“Paul Pelosi Jr. is a member of management team of Viscoil Group of Companies and NRGLab. Paul Pelosi Jr. is interested in developing clean energy that can replace gasoline and diesel as transportation fuel sources,” read the description on the video.

“Walter Afanasieff, Brandon Stone, Mika Newton and other artists are actively involved in promoting the clean technology of Viscoil Group of Companies and NRGLab. For example, Mika Newton helped to secure the rights to build a plant for the production of SH-boxes in Ukraine,” read the description of an NRGLab & Research Council video.
 
Mika Newton is a Ukrainian-born singer.

A 2013 interview with NRGLab’s lead technician Zeev Drori reported that NRGLab was funded by environmental businesswoman Ana Shell, who writes about Ukraine energy issues on her blog. In the interview, Drori discussed gas generation techniques in Ukraine.

“Currently, Ana Shell Fund also provide finances and support to groom talented artistes like Mika Newton, a Ukrainian singer who represented Ukraine in the Eurovision song contest in 2011,” reported a 2013 interview with Ana Shell, referring to the singer who brokered the S-H box deal in Ukraine.

“In brief, SH-boxes are environmentally friendly generators which employs the use of poly-crystal technology to producing electricity from environmental heat. With the SH-boxes, electricity could be generated more efficiently and cleanly at a lower cost,” the interview with Ana Shell notes.

Here is Mika Newton performing as Ukraine’s representative on a Eurovision talent contest:

NRGLab’s website states that the company is based in Singapore and notes, “The company’s additional projects include a strategic partnership and investment from Viscoil Holdings to recycle waste materials into eco-friendly diesel fuel. NRGLab has obtained an exclusive license for the Viscoil Technology for the South East Asian region for all raw materials.”

Viscoil Holdings is currently suspended by the California Secretary of State. It was registered in 2009 to a manager named David Strawn in Escondido, California. As of 2010, it listed two managers: Strawn and an individual named Sergey Sorokin based in Moscow, Russia. 

Paul Pelosi Jr. co-founded the company Natural Blue Resources, which the SEC charged with securities fraud in 2014.

Nancy Pelosi led a congressional delegation to Ukraine in 2015 to discuss issues including “energy security.”",

HSBC has become the latest lender to offer a mortgage deal with an interest rate of less than 1% in the latest sally of an intensifying mortgage rate war.

Banks and building societies are fighting for customers in a frenzied property market, described by the Bank of England’s chief economist as “on fire” as the government’s stamp duty holiday combines with big deposits saved during lockdown to ramp up demand.

On Friday, HSBC cut the rate on its two-year fixed product for those with deposits or equity of at least 40% by 0.05%, bringing it down to 0.99%. Borrowers have to pay a fee of £999 but the last time the bank offered a rate this low was nearly five years ago.

HSBC said people looking at moving on to or up the property ladder, or who had a fixed rate deal coming to an end, could secure “some of the lowest rates we have offered for a while”.

A number of lenders have already launched sub-1% deals with Platform, the intermediary lending arm of the Co-operative Bank, cutting the rate on its 40% deposit product to just 0.95% this week. This is the lowest rate available on the market.

These deals were “great” if you had an impeccable credit rating, a standard source of income and a very large deposit available, said Matthew Fleming-Duffy, a director at Cherry Mortgage & Finance.

“These products are great for a minority of consumers and certainly put these lenders at the top of best-buy tables, but for many potential borrowers – with more complex needs or smaller deposits – these attractive rates are sadly out of reach.”

Demand for property has pushed average house prices up 10.9% over the past year, the fastest pace for almost seven years, according to the Nationwide building society. Prices rose on average by 1.8% in May, after a 2.3% rise in April, according to the figures, pushing the annual rate of increase up from 7.1% a month earlier.

As a result, the average price of a house in Britain has hit a high of £242,832, up nearly £24,000 over the past 12 months. A decade ago, in May 2011, the average UK house price was below £170,000.

Mark Harris, the chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said it was a “super-competitive market for borrowers” with banks eager to lend given the low base rate. “We are sitting here thinking how much lower can rates go?” he added.

“There is a desire from the big balance sheet lenders who have got cash on their book at zero in terms of paying deposit rates, so even if it is going out the door at 1%, while that margin is skinny, it is still a margin.”",

Opal Lee was 12 when a mob of white supremacists vandalised and set fire to her family's home in Fort Worth, Texas.

Helpless, she watched her home burn to the ground as police stood by, doing nothing to stop the violence.

The attack happened in 1939 on 19 June, a symbolic date that commemorates the end of slavery in the US.

Known as Juneteenth, the date would leave a lasting impression on Ms Lee, who channelled her experiences of racism into a life of teaching, activism and campaigning.

\"The fact that [the attack] happened on the 19th day of June has spurred me to make people understand that Juneteenth is not just a festival,\" she told Fort Worth Star-Telegram newspaper in February.

\"It should be a unifier. The slaves didn't free themselves.\"

For decades, Ms Lee worked tirelessly to get Juneteenth recognised as a national holiday in the US.

Now aged 94, Ms Lee has finally got her day off.

'We waited so long'
On Thursday US President Joe Biden signed a bill into law to make 19 June a national holiday commemorating the emancipation of enslaved black Americans.

Juneteenth marks the day on 19 June 1865 when enslaved black people in Texas learned they had been freed. They were among the last to be told the news, two months after the end of the Civil War.

The liberation came more than two-and-half years after President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation during the war, declaring all enslaved people in the rebellious southern states to be free.

A national holiday to recognise this day was long overdue, said Ms Lee, who was present when President Biden signed the bill.

Hailing her as an \"incredible woman\", Mr Biden gave Ms Lee the first pen he used to sign the bill into law. Mr Biden then asked the audience to give Ms Lee a standing ovation.

\"We waited so long to be first-class citizens and this is one of the ways to acknowledge that our ancestors weren't free for two-and-a-half years after the Emancipation Proclamation,\" Ms Lee said.

\"We still got much work to do and we see this as a great beginning to do something about the disparities in our country.\"

The grandmother of Juneteenth
Affectionately known as the grandmother of Juneteenth, Ms Lee was born on 7 October 1926 in Marshall, Texas.

The attack on her family home in 1939 came two years after they had moved to a predominantly white neighbourhood in Fort Worth.

\"The people didn't want us. They started gathering. The paper said the police couldn't control the mob,\" Ms Lee told a local TV station.

In an interview with broadcaster CNN, Ms Lee said her parents buckled down, worked hard, bought a new home and never spoke of the incident again.

In adult life, Ms Lee forged a career as a teacher in Fort Worth, where she worked in a primary school for 15 years. She later obtained a master's degree in counselling and served as a school counsellor until her retirement in 1977.

Her retirement gave her the opportunity to plunge into activism.

She has been a prominent community organiser for several causes, including access to housing and preserving the history of black Americans in Fort Worth.

This commitment to recalling memories of her ancestors foreshadowed her Juneteenth campaign.

Change is afoot
As a teacher, Ms Lee helped organise festivals to mark Juneteenth which, she told the New York Times newspaper, was \"like going to Christmas or Thanksgiving\".

But it wasn't until later in life that the date took on renewed resonance. At 89, she decided something needed to be done.

In 2016, Ms Lee attempted to walk 1,400 miles (2,253km) from her home in Fort Worth to Washington DC in an effort to get Juneteenth named a national holiday.

She travelled 2.5 miles each day to symbolise the two-and-a-half years that black Texans waited for freedom after the Emancipation Proclamation.

With each footstep, Ms Lee walked closer to her goal.

This year, she'll tread the same path knowing the hard yards have been done.

\"Walking tomorrow is going to be a joy,\" she told ABC News's Good Morning America programme. \"We need to go about the business of everybody participating.\"",

LONDON (Bywire News) - On Tuesday, David Frost, the British Brexit minister, said that there will be \"a problem\" if the European Union isn't more realistic over the implementation of the Northern Ireland trade segment of the Brexit divorce deal.

Frost said to a parliamentary committee, \"What we would want to see is a kind of more pragmatic approach from the EU. If their approach is simply to say, you must just implement the EU customs' code as if this were any other external frontier of the EU, then we obviously have a problem.\" 

According to Frost, currently, the EU is behaving in a non-practical manner. 

\"That's not what's happening. The delicate balance in the Good Friday Agreement risks being unsettled.\"
